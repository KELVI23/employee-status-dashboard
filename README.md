# Employee Status Dashboard
This is an Employee Status Dashboard where employees can update their current work status and search for other employees based on their name or location. The dashboard supports admin and employee roles, offering customized functionality for each role.

## Features

- **Employee Status Update**: Employees can update their current status (In-Office, Working from Home, On Leave, or a custom status).
- **User Search**: Employees can search for other employees by name using a fast search mechanism powered by a Trie data structure.
- **Location Filter**: Users can filter users based on their office location.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The dashboard automatically refreshes every second to keep employee statuses up to date.
- **Out of Office Scheduling**: Admins can set automatic "Out of Office" schedules for users based on location. For example:
  - `Scheduled "Out of Office" for India at 03:00`
- **Update Status Notification**: Users receive a notification of their last updated status upon login.
- **User Persistence**: Once logged in, users remain logged in until they explicitly log out.
- **Application Auto-Update**: The application automatically checks for updates and installs them on user machines, ensuring users always have the latest version.
- **Application Launch on PC Startup**: The application is configured to launch automatically when the PC starts.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hardcoded but encrypted. The default admin credentials are:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `gs`
  - ðŸš« There is no "Forgot Password" or backdoor option.

## Search Mechanism

The search functionality is powered by a **Trie** data structure. This allows for efficient searching of users by name, even in large datasets.

- **Trie Implementation**: A Trie is used to store user names, and as the user types in the search bar, the Trie provides fast lookups for matching names.
- **Display of Results**: The results from the Trie search are displayed in the table, updating in real-time as you type.
